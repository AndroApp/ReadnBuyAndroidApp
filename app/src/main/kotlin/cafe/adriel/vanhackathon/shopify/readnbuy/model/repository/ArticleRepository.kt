                "<p><b>ARE you a bike rider who worries constantly your bicycle will get stolen whenever you lock it up on the street?</b></p><p>Well, a US company might mean you’ll never have to worry again after developing a lock that is sure to make would-be thieves vomit. Literally.</p><p>Called SkunkLock, this steel U-Lock is designed with a built-in deterrent of very potent and legally compliant gas that escapes when the lock is cut open.</p><p>This formula has the ability to compromise sight, cause shortness of breath, induce vomiting and permanently sticks to the clothes worn by the bike burglar.</p><div class='product' data-product-id='6518534149'><img class='product-image' src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1559/2201/products/61DZeqOWMOL._SL1500_00f9172f-e380-421a-b5c7-51a64cabbabe_grande.jpg?v=1477224525'><div class='product-price'><sup>$</sup>45</div></div><p>“After witnessing first hand, and becoming victims of bike theft ourselves, we realised that people don’t need a bigger stronger lock, we needed a lock with a fundamental deterrent,” says inventor and entrepreneur Daniel Idzkowski, who created the lock with his co-inventor, Yves Perrenoud.</p><p>“After six months of work, we created SkunkLock. Skunklock is a hardened medium-carbon steel U-Lock that’s as difficult to compromise as the strongest U-Locks, AND comes with a surprise.</p><p>“It’s pressurised inside with a noxious chemical deterrent that slams the would-be thief with noxious chemicals. The chemicals are so disgusting they induce vomit in the majority of cases, and elicit an instinctive response to run away immediately.”</p><div class='product' data-product-id='6518540741'><img class='product-image' src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1559/2201/products/61DZeqOWMOL._SL1500_grande.jpg?v=1477224395'><div class='product-price'><sup>$</sup>19</div></div><p>If anyone attempts to cut into the Skunklock it instantaneously emits the sick-making chemical, a proprietary compound called ‘formula D-1’, which the company boasts has “economic implications for the thief”.</p><p>“Our formula irreversibly ruins the clothes worn by the thief or any of the protection they may be wearing, and replacing these items is likely more expensive than the resale value of your stolen bike (generally only 1/10 of the retail price).”</p><p>Describing the effects of the compound, Idzkowski told the Guardian: “At two feet it was pretty bad. It was absolutely vomit inducing in 99 per cent of people. At five feet it’s very noticeable and the initial reaction is to move away from it. At 10ft it’s definitely detectable and very unpleasant.”</p><p>The SkunkLock team is appealing for funding on crowd-funding site Indiegogo, where anyone who pledges $99 should receive their lock by June next year.</p>",

                "<p>Ok, phew, winter’s over. Now that all those winter garments have been cleaned and laundered, it’s time to figure out where to put them until next year.</p><p>It’s only logical to throw items into boxes, right? Wrong! It’s important to take the extra step and properly fold, hang and store your clothing so they can last many seasons.</p><p>In an effort to help with your spring cleaning, we talked to some experts about storing off-season items. Take care of your stuff with the below tips for small spaces, precious materials and preventing mold and bugs. Here’s to years of a fresh and organized winter wardrobe.</p><p><b>Clear containers are great vessels for holding tons of clothes</b></p><p>Tide Ambassador and lifestyle blogger Carley Knobloch uses transparent containers for organizing. “I like clear bins — I photograph everything that’s in them and create a digital file of all the photos, so I can flip through it at a glance and know exactly what’s where for next season.”</p><div class='product' data-product-id='6518550341'><img class='product-image' src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1559/2201/products/Next-Zip-Through-Hoody-5521-0421453-1-pdp_slider_l_grande.jpg?v=1477162232'><div class='product-price'><sup>$</sup>99</div></div><p>California Closet’s Scott agrees, saying that containers or boxes are better than dresser drawers. Drawers, she believes, should “only be for the things that you’re wearing on a regular basis, like underwear, swimsuits and workout clothes.”</p><p>Saving space is also important, so air-vacuumed plastic bags can definitely come in handy. But, beware, as Apartment Therapy’s Ryan notes, “using vacuum bags can really maximize your storage space, but they don’t allow your clothes to breathe at all, so limit their use to casual clothes like sweatshirts, pajamas and socks.”</p><p><b>To hang or to fold, that is the question</b></p><p>This is admittedly one of the biggest struggles. Neglecting either option can result in wrinkles and weakened fabric quality. First, think of the fabric. Scott says that natural fiber fabric tends to get drawn out on a hanger, so fabrics such as cashmere or wool are typically better off folded. Duane Schumann, Restoration Manager of Treasured Garment Restoration, adds acrylic fibers and poly fibers to that list and says it’s best to fold these items with “acid free tissue in between the folded areas.”</p><p>Jeans and shirts, like casual button downs, can also be folded into more of a roll shape, so they can stack horizontally instead of vertically, which leaves room for more clothes, says Ryan.</p><p>Always pay close attention to the type of hanger used. For materials like silk or cotton, “think about using more of a padded hanger so that those shoulders don’t get drawn out into a real thin line by using wire hangers,” Scott says. She recommends bringing specialty hangers to the dry cleaners.</p><div class='product' data-product-id='6518552069'><img class='product-image' src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1559/2201/products/Next-Maroon-Marl-Grandad-Top-3761-2931453-1-pdp_slider_l_grande.jpg?v=1477162267'><div class='product-price'><sup>$</sup>109</div></div><p>Try keeping hanging items in dry spaces, but let them breathe. Instead of plastic garment bags, which Schumann says can “emit gas under higher heat conditions in the summer and stain due to the oils emitted,” use muslin or cotton bags which let clothing get a breath of fresh air.</p><p><b>Avoid mothballs and try lavender or cedar</b></p><p>If clothing isn’t put away properly, bugs and mold are more likely to attack. Although mothballs seem like the number one way to combat pests, they are actually bad for storage.</p><p>Mothballs not only smell terribly, but the materials used to make some of them have come under scrutiny in the past. As alternatives, the experts recommend components like cedar (in any form), lavender sachets and even lemon peel rinds, which keep items dry and nice smelling.</p><div class='product' data-product-id='6518553797'><img class='product-image' src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1559/2201/products/Next-Ecru-Slub-Grandad-1202-4100771-1-pdp_slider_l_grande.jpg?v=1477162290'><div class='product-price'><sup>$</sup>79</div></div><p>Be careful around cedar, though, as it can be too drying. “The problem with cedar is that it dehydrates anything that’s around,” Scott says, and when natural materials like real fur and leather come into the picture, “it pulls the oils out.” When these oils are removed, those fabrics become brittle and shed or crack.</p>",

                "<p>The death toll in Haiti is currently estimated at between 500 to 1,300 people following the October 4th landfall of Hurricane Matthew — the most severe to affect the region in more than half a century.</p><p>While much of the international media attention has been focused on the Tiburon Peninsula, which encompasses all of Haiti’s Southern coast, the devastation to cropland throughout Haiti has been equally merciless. Relief efforts to this point have been largely focused on emergency and crisis response, though more about the depth of the agricultural destruction — both for cash crops such as coffee and cacao, as well as food crops — is coming to light.</p><p>Coffee has historically been a primary crop for Haiti — the sovereign state has at times been one of the world’s largest producers — although the sector’s struggles in recent years have followed widespread deforestation, lack of infrastructure and market access. Numerous individual organizations locally and abroad have been working tirelessly to help reestablish Haitian coffee, though anecdotal evidence to this point suggests that much of that progress may have been washed away through the hurricane.</p><div class='product' data-product-id='6518569797'><img class='product-image' src='https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1559/2201/products/71JYnCP83NL._SX522_grande.jpg?v=1477162570'><div class='product-price'><sup>$</sup>29</div></div><p>But, you can help.
